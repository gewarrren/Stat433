## Summary:

The delay times for flights can depend on a number of factors, but based
on this data set, we can look to see what flights have longer delay
times by the time of day.

``` r
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    ## 
    ##     filter, lag

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

``` r
# Viewing which hours of the day (time of day) have the largest average delays

delay_flights = flights %>% 
  group_by(hour) %>% 
  filter(dep_delay > 0, arr_delay > 0) %>% 
  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE),
            mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_dep_delay), 
          desc(mean_arr_delay))

delay_flights
```
